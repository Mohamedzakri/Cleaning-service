Search for housekeepers based on filters

    DB:
        1. Leverage Database Indexing
        Why: Proper indexing on frequently filtered or searched columns significantly reduces query execution time.
        How: Use composite indexes for multiple columns and ensure indexes are relevant to your filtering criteria. Monitor index usage via PostgreSQL's EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
        3. Database-Side Preprocessing
        Utilize PostgreSQL's powerful query features like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for intermediate data processing, which can simplify complex query logic and improve maintainability.
        Alternative Approaches
        2. Stored Procedures or Functions
        Encapsulate complex query logic within PostgreSQL stored procedures or functions.
        Benefits: Centralized logic, better performance for heavy computations, and reduced application-side complexity.

        Design and maintain appropriate indexes based on search patterns
        Use materialized views for complex, frequently-accessed data
        Implement database partitioning for large datasets
        Consider denormalization where appropriate

        3. Modular Query Design
        Break down large queries into smaller reusable components or fragments, which can then be assembled dynamically.
        Tools like Spring Dataâ€™s @Query with named native queries or custom query builders make this approach feasible.
    Service:
        1. Use Specification or Criteria API
        Why: These APIs provide programmatic ways to construct complex and dynamic queries, making them easier to maintain and read compared to embedding raw queries in annotations.
        How: Use JPA Specifications or Spring Data's Query by Example (QBE) to dynamically build filters. Libraries like Hibernate's Criteria API or Spring's JpaSpecificationExecutor allow you to express conditions in Java, which are then translated to SQL.
        2. Query DSL Libraries
        Why: Libraries like QueryDSL or JOOQ can help construct SQL queries in a type-safe manner. These tools are particularly useful when the filtering and search logic is non-trivial and requires runtime construction of queries.
        How: They provide fluent APIs to build SQL queries programmatically, enabling better readability and reuse compared to manual concatenation or @Query.
        3. Paginate Results
        Why: Large result sets can degrade performance and increase latency.
        How: Always paginate results using Spring Data's Pageable or limit/offset techniques in custom queries.
        4. Caching Strategies
        Why: Frequently used queries or filters can benefit from caching to reduce database load.
        How: Use a caching layer like Redis or Spring Cache to store results of commonly used queries.

        Implement result pagination
        Use reactive streams effectively
        Cache query results where appropriate
        Implement batch processing for large datasets

    other layers:
        4. View Materialization
        Why: For frequently accessed but computation-intensive queries, creating a materialized view in PostgreSQL can offload runtime query processing.
        How: Refresh these views periodically or on-demand to balance performance and freshness.
        2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
        Why: For complex systems, separating write operations (commands) from read operations (queries) ensures scalability and specialization in query handling.
        How: Implement a separate read model using optimized views, denormalized tables, or read-optimized databases like Elasticsearch.

For simple queries (basic CRUD, single-table operations):
Use built-in R2DBC repository methods or simple @Query annotations

For medium complexity (2-3 table joins, basic filtering):

Best Practices for Complex Query Management


3. Dynamic Query Construction
Why: When the filter combinations are large, dynamic construction of queries based on input parameters avoids bloated or hard-to-maintain pre-defined queries.
How: Use tools like Spring Data's Predicate with R2DBC or libraries such as QueryDSL to dynamically generate queries based on request parameters.

Performance Optimization


3. Use Joins and Subqueries Judiciously
Why: While joins and subqueries are powerful, they can slow down queries if overused or poorly optimized.
How: Use them only when necessary and analyze query execution plans to identify bottlenecks.

Industry Standards
1. Reactive-Friendly Query Execution
Use R2DBC native features or Spring Data R2DBC repositories for non-blocking database interactions. Avoid JPA or Hibernate in reactive systems since they are not designed for asynchronous processing.


1. Using Search Engines
For highly dynamic and complex filtering (e.g., full-text search, multi-field filtering), consider integrating a search engine like Elasticsearch.
Benefits: Advanced filtering, full-text search, and better handling of large datasets.
